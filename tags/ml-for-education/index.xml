The comparison between drawing and writing shall be made between kids of different grades using about a 100 features based on tilt, pressure and veloocity of the strokes. Since the kids inhigher grades can be expected to be more proficient in writing, our analysis can give insights into the transfer of skills between the tasks of drawing and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
